# TLD.js
``.io`` was a hawt TLD for 

# Kickstarter
The kickstart project is to raise the funds to apply for buying the .js top level domain.

# Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the web... shouldn't we have a TLD that 
we control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... Node.js goes to the node project, etc.

Got a side project and need a cheap, hawt name? heavymetal.js or whatever is yours.

Domain squaters will not be tolreated, to the best of the projects ability to limit or ban this...

# Who will run this?
I'm offering to volunteer my time to organize this applicaiton process. If we get it, we'll create a 
governance committee to figure how to best steward this beast. I'll volunteer my time to steer this for 
the first couple years.

An early suggestion would be getting under Mozilla.org's non-profit umbrella, but the we can 
figure this out after a successful application.
