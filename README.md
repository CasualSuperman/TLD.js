# TLD.js
``.io`` was an awesome TLD for projects like [Socket.io](http://socket.io/). What if we had **.js for fantastic 
JavaScript** and Nodejs projects. You should have free or cheap domains for your Hacking pleasure.

# Kickstarter
The kickstart project is to raise the funds to apply for buying the .js top level domain.

I've not done this before. I don't have $200,000 lying around. I need your help!

# Rewards

## $20
Skip coffee for a week and join the TLD.js movement!

Limited to first 10,000 pledges. No, seriously remember how fast JSConf sells out ;)

## $500


# Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the web every day... shouldn't we have a TLD that 
we JS hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... jquery.js to jquery, node.js goes to the node project, etc.

Got a side project and need a *cheap*, **hawt name**? heavymetal.js or whatever is yours.

Domain squaters will not be tolerated, to the best of the projects ability to limit or ban this behavior...

# After Kickstarter
Again, the governance committee would figure out how to make care and feeding of TLD.js sustainable
and low maintence. This is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough funds
to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.js`` domains will be  as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a way to reward everyone who helped us 
secure this TLD.

# Who will run this?
I'm offering to volunteer my time to organize this applicaiton process. If we get it, we'll create a 
governance committee to figure how to best steward this beast. I'll volunteer my time to steer this for 
the first couple years.

An early suggestion would be getting under Mozilla.org's non-profit umbrella, but the we can 
figure this out after a successful application.
